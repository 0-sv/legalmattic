## Binding Contract

These Use Terms are a contract between you and us and govern your WooCommerce Service use. Agreeing to these Use Terms is a condition of any WooCommerce Service use. You signify your agreement to these Use Terms and are legally bound by them from the date on which you:

*   Click to accept or agree to these Use Terms where WooCommerce presents an option to do so, either on the Website or otherwise; or
*   Use the Services in any way, in which case you understand and agree that your WooCommerce Service use will signify your acceptance of these Use Terms from the moment you first begin to use the WooCommerce Service.
*   Your use of certain features offered via WooCommerce, such as those related to tax calculation, payment, and shipping, require Jetpack to function. As such, if you enable or use those features, the terms related to Jetpack and Ecommerce [here](https://en.wordpress.com/tos/) also apply.

This is version 2.0 of these Use Terms and their effective date is 2013–12–01.

### CPA Application

A “transaction” (as defined in the CPA) between you and us may or may not fall under the provisions of the CPA depending upon whether certain of our Customer’s threshold values are below a certain value at the time the transaction is entered into. The threshold values relate to a Customer’s asset value or annual turnover, and the value against which they are measured is as determined by the Minister of Trade and Industry by publication in the Government Gazette from time to time. Our duties towards you may vary depending upon whether the transaction in question is subject to the CPA, and we will rely on information you give us in order to determine whether the CPA applies. Consequently:

*   You warrant that any statement you make to us regarding relevant threshold values is accurate.
*   We may require you to provide us with the supporting financial statements as proof of any threshold values which you may represent as being below the relevant values, or in the event it appears that the CPA applies to our contract with you in the form of these Use Terms.
*   You agree that [we may hold you liable](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#indemnity) for any losses we sustain as a result, if you misrepresent any threshold values and we are subsequently penalised as a result of our reliance on your misrepresentations, .

### Amendments

You agree that we may, in our sole discretion, amend these Use Terms at any time, in any way and from time to time. We will publish details of our proposed amendments to these Use Terms in a notice to this effect on our Website. This notice will identify the specific amendments we propose making to these Use Terms and the date on which these proposed amendments will become effective. You agree that such a notice will be adequate notice of the proposed amendments and that these amendments shall automatically come into effect on the date specified in this notice. You further agree that it is your responsibility to review these Use Terms regularly in the event that we do publish a notice of proposed changes. Your continued use of the WooCommerce Service (except where your continued use of WooCommerce Service is permissible in terms of, for example, specific licenses) will be subject to you agreeing to the amended Use Terms.

## Interpreting these Use Terms

These Use Terms contains a number of words and phrases which have specific meanings and most of which are capitalised. The [Glossary](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#glossary), below, contains many of these words and phrases (others are set out in these Use Terms’ body and are designated by terms in quotation marks). We also apply certain rules when interpreting these Use Terms and the [Interpretation Guide](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#interpretationguide), which sets out these rules, is below.

## Duration

These Use Terms shall continue to bind you for so long as you make use of WooCommerce Service.

### Effects of Termination

In the event these Use Terms are terminated for any reason whatsoever, the following clauses shall survive termination and continue to bind you:

*   [Fees](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#fees);
*   [Liability](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#liability);
*   [Breach](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#breach);
*   [Governing Law and Jurisdiction](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#governinglawandjurisdiction); and
*   [Domicilium and Notices](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#domiciliumandnotices).

## The WooCommerce Service

Our Website details the WooCommerce Service which, broadly, comprises the following components:

*   Products;
*   Support Service;
*   Content;
*   Related Software Products.

We grant you a limited and non-exclusive right to use the WooCommerce Service (subject to any other applicable licenses such as the GPL) solely for the purposes which the WooCommerce Service is intended for and as permitted by the licenses applicable to the WooCommerce Service components. This right is not transferable to any other person [unless we agree](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#assignment). You agree that, except where the nature of the WooCommerce Service requires otherwise, each component of the WooCommerce Service constitutes a separate and distinct service, and we are not necessarily obliged to render two or more components of the WooCommerce Service as a single, indivisible service.

### Products

Our products are licensed under the GPL ([click here to find out more about the GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)). When you purchase paid Products, you will receive access to a Support Service for those Products for a period of one year. You may renew the Support Service for your paid Products on the anniversary of your paid Products’ purchase. For more information about the Support Service, [read below](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#supportservice). Some of our Products have been contributed by 3rd Party service providers. These 3rd Party service providers may change from time to time and the Products they contribute may not always be available through the WooCommerce Service.

### Support Service

As we pointed out above, when you purchase paid Products, you will receive access to a Support Service developed to support the specific paid Products you have purchased. The Website contains more information about the specific Support Service you receive with each paid Product purchase. The corresponding Support Service is valid for 1 year from the date of your purchase, regardless of which paid Product you purchase, after which time the Support Service will come to an end. Support Services are only available to you and you may not transfer them to any other person without our express, written consent. We may refuse to give consent for this at our discretion.

### Content use

WooCommerce grants users a Content License in respect of WooCommerce’ Intellectual Property which forms part of the Services. To the extent that any copying, reproduction, distribution, transmission, display, broadcasting or publishing of any Content is expressly permitted (such permission to be interpreted in its most restrictive sense) users may do so, provided that all trademarks, trade names and all copyright, ownership, proprietary and confidentiality notices included on or in relation to the Content are retained and displayed without alteration or modification and not in any manner obscured or removed. Users are further required, as a condition of this Content License, to clearly and expressly attribute WooCommerce as the Content’s source. Users acknowledge that they do not acquire any ownership rights or rights to use the Content except where explicitly permitted to do so. In the event WooCommerce revokes the Content License, users may no longer use the Content.

### Changes to the Services

We may change any aspect of the WooCommerce Service on written notice to you. These changes may include discontinuing aspects of the WooCommerce Service or the WooCommerce Service in its entirety. In the event we do make any changes to any aspect of the WooCommerce Service, we will publish updated WooCommerce Service information which shall detail the –

*   proposed changes to the WooCommerce Service; and
*   the date on which these proposed changes shall be implemented.

Changes to the WooCommerce Service may, at our sole discretion, require consequential changes to [fees payable](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#fees) for and delivery timeframes applicable to the aspects of the WooCommerce Service affected by the changes. We will similarly notify you of any such changes to [fees payable](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/#fees) or delivery timeframes.

### Fees

Subscription fees are payable in advance. By purchasing a Subscription, you authorize us to charge your payment method immediately and on a pre-pay basis for the Subscription period indicated. We may, in our sole discretion, suspend any aspect of the WooCommerce Service which you have not paid for.

To avoid a potential disruption to your Subscriptions, we offer automatic renewal, and it is enabled by default for all purchases. Unless you notify WooCommerce before the end of the applicable Subscription period that you want to cancel, your Subscription will automatically renew, and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable monthly or annual fee (which may change) for such Subscription (as well as any taxes that WooCommerce has the legal obligation to collect or pay) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. To cancel, you can remove your credit card from the [My Account](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/) page.

You may claim a refund of any fees you have paid for any Subscription within 1 month of your purchase. Your use of the WooCommerce Service you are claiming a refund for may be terminated when you are refunded. Without detracting from any of our rights, you agree that we are entitled to discontinue any aspect of the Subscription you may be using if you fail to pay any amount when it falls due or if you breach these Use Terms. In the event we incur expenses to recover amounts you owe us, you further agree that we may recover our legal costs on the attorney and own client scale, collection charges and tracing fees, and any applicable VAT.

## Breach

Subject to any other provision of these Use Terms providing for the remedy of any breach of any provision of these Use Terms, should either Party (“the Offending Party”) commit a breach of any provision of these Use Terms and fail to remedy such breach within 10 days of receiving written notice from the other Party (“the Aggrieved Party”) requiring the Offending Party to do so, then the Aggrieved Party shall be entitled, without prejudice to its other rights in law to:

*   Cancel these Use Terms, provided the breach in question is a material breach going to the root of these Use Terms; or
*   Claim specific performance of all of the Offending Party’s obligations whether or not due for performance

in either event without prejudice to the Aggrieved Party’s right to claim damages. Either Party shall be entitled to summarily terminate these Use Terms in the event of the other Party being placed in liquidation or under judicial management, whether provisionally or finally, or in the event of the other Party entering into a compromise with its creditors generally.

## Interruption Event

You acknowledge that, from time to time, the WooCommerce Service may be suspended due to causes beyond our control which we refer to as Interruption Events.

We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of an Interruption Event in writing as soon as we become reasonably aware of the Interruption Event. In the event that an Interruption Event exceeds 2 calendar months and in the event that neither we or our nominee are able to provide alternative services and/or facilities, either you or we may terminate these Use Terms and shall only remain liable for performance under these Use Terms which fell due immediately prior to the Interruption Event.

## Interpretation Guide

In these Use Terms, headings are for convenience and are not intended to be used to interpret the Use Terms. If the Use Terms refers to a Party who is liquidated or sequestrated (or has been through a comparable process under a different legal system), then the Use Terms will also be applicable to and binding on that Party’s liquidator or trustee, as the case may be. Unless these Use Terms indicates to the contrary, any references to any gender includes the other genders, a natural person includes an artificial person and vice versa, the singular includes the plural and vice versa. The rule of construction that the contract shall be interpreted against the Party responsible for the drafting or preparation of these Use Terms, shall not apply. Where in these Use Terms provision is made for the Parties (or either of them) to agree on or grant approval in respect of any matter, such Use Terms or approval shall only be valid and binding on the Parties thereto if reduced to writing and signed by the duly authorised representative of such Parties. The use of the word “including” followed by a specific example shall not be construed as limiting the meaning of the general wording preceding it and the [eiusdem generis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation#Internal_and_external_consistency) rule shall not be applied in the interpretation of such general wording or such specific example. Where these Use Terms specifies any number of days, the number of days excludes the first day and includes the last day unless the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or gazetted public holiday in the Republic of South Africa, in which case the last day shall be the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or gazetted public holiday in the Republic of South Africa. Generally speaking, references to a “day” are references to typical business days. Any reference to “business hours” shall be construed as being the hours between 08h30 (eight hours and thirty minutes) and 17h00 (seventeen hours) on any day. Any reference to time shall be based upon South African Standard Time; All annexures, addenda and amendments to these Use Terms form an integral part of these Use Terms and, therefore, our contract with you. The words and phrases in the Glossary and, where appropriate, elsewhere in these Use Terms bear the meanings assigned to them and related expressions bear corresponding meanings.
