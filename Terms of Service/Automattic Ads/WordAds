Automattic reserves the right to display advertisements on your blog unless you have purchased an Ad-free Upgrade or a VIP Services account; provided that if you have been invited to participate in and have opted into our WordAds program (“WordAds”), and your participation in WordAds has not been terminated, then the following terms shall apply instead.

**For all sites included in the WordAds program:**

Automattic may, in its sole discretion, display graphic advertisements selected by Automattic on each page of your blog (the “Advertisements”).

You agree to reasonably cooperate with Automattic (including providing necessary information, access and support) as may be required to display the Advertisements on your blog, and will promptly notify Automattic in the event that there is any delay or malfunction in the display of Advertisements on your blog.

You acknowledge that the Advertisements may not display properly (or at all) depending on the WordPress theme you have selected for your blog, or for a variety of other reasons.

You may not participate in WordAds if you use a WordPress theme that is not fully compatible with the display of Advertisements.

You may not make any changes to any Advertisements or otherwise interfere with the display of any Advertisements.

If requested by Automattic, you will display a link to the WordAds “Advertise With Us” page (or successor page) on any page of your blog where advertising is solicited; provided that the format of such link shall be subject to Automattic’s ongoing review and approval.

You hereby consent to the use of your name, likeness, blog name, and any associated content or logos by Automattic in connection with advertisements, articles, and other similar communications conducted by Automattic relating to WordAds.

Without Automattic’s prior written consent in each instance, you will not solicit or respond to solicitations (either directly or indirectly) from companies advertising on WordAds.

You must be at least 18 years old to participate in the WordAds program.  By agreeing to these terms, you represent that you are 18 or older.

Your blog must not contain any mature material (as determined by Automattic, in our discretion) or content that violates WordPress.com’s [Terms of Service](http://en.wordpress.com/tos/).

You will disclose to Automattic any paid products or services you employ to refer visitors to your site or to generate clicks on any ads that appear on your site.

We use a third party, comScore, Inc. (“comScore”), to measure audience and usage. By participating in the WordAds program, we have the right to assign the traffic relating to your site to Automattic, and you authorize us to sign a Traffic Assignment Letter on your behalf for comScore audience measurement reports. If we assign your site’s traffic to Automattic, your site will not receive credit for traffic in these reports, and you must not assign your site’s traffic to any other party. If we or comScore require additional documentation to verify ownership of your site or domain name, you agree to make reasonable efforts to accommodate such requests. Your site’s traffic will no longer be assigned to Automattic if you discontinue your participation in the WordAds program. Assigning your site’s traffic to Automattic allows us to use aggregated traffic stats to obtain more favorable rates for all WordAds program participants, including yourself.

**For WordPress.com sites only:**

In order to participate in the WordAds program, your blog must be on a custom domain (i.e., not on a wordpress.com domain).

You will not display on your blog any advertising or branding (including any widgets or badges) provided by advertisers or advertising networks other than WordAds (“Third Party Advertisers”).

**Revenue and Payments (applicable to all sites in the WordAds program):**

Subject to these terms of service, and provided that you are currently participating in the WordAds program, Automattic will pay you a revenue share of the ad payments received by Automattic in connection with WordAds for Advertisements displayed on your blog, which revenue share shall be calculated by Automattic in accordance with its then-current internal WordAds revenue sharing policy. Automattic will issue monthly payments approximately 45 days following the end of each month in which the applicable ad payments are received by Automattic. All payments will be made via PayPal, and you must maintain an active PayPal account in order to be entitled to payment hereunder. Automattic shall have no obligation to make any payment under this section until the outstanding amount owed to you exceeds one hundred US dollars ($100).

WordAds participants residing in the US must provide a tax ID.

If you wish to discontinue your participation in the WordAds program, you may do so in the WordAds settings page of your participating blog(s).  Automattic will distribute remaining earnings to discontinued sites so long as the amount exceeds $25.
