# Store Guidelines
As mentioned in our [Terms of Service](https://wordpress.com/tos/) , your WordPress.com [Store](https://wordpress.com/support/store/) must not violate our [WordPress.com User Guidelines](https://wordpress.com/support/user-guidelines/) or sell any items that are prohibited, fraudulent, abusive, hazardous, or illegal. For example, you may not sell (or facilitate the sale of) any of the following in (or through) your store:

* Firearms or other weaponry, including parts, accessories, and ammunition
* Fireworks
* Pornography
* Adult services
* Controlled and highly-regulated substances (including alcohol, tobacco products and e-liquids, marijuana, cannabidiol or CBD, and other cannabis-derived products)
* Personal information
* Content that infringes on anyone’s intellectual property rights

Bear in mind that these are just guidelines — **interpretations are solely up to us**. These guidelines are not exhaustive and are subject to change.

If you believe a store has violated our [Terms of Service](https://wordpress.com/tos/) or these guidelines, please [report the site](https://wordpress.com/support/report-blogs/). We aim to promptly review and investigate all complaints that we receive, but if and how we respond will depend on a variety of factors, such as the information available to us and the type of violation. We may also contact the site owner to inform them of the complaint.
