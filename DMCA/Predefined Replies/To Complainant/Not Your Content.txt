Hello,

After reviewing your notice and the material you claim to be infringing, we are concerned that your complaint may not properly fall under the DMCA. DMCA notices may only be submitted for works where you are the copyright owner or an agent acting on behalf of that owner.

Please note that you may be liable for damages if you knowingly materially misrepresent your copyrights and we may seek to collect those damages:
