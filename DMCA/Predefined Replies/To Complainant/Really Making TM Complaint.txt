Hello,

We reviewed your recently submitted DMCA notice, but we do not believe that your complaint properly falls under the provisions of the DMCA as the material at issue does not appear to be copyrightable subject matter. See http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html for more information.

Please note that you may be liable for damages if you “knowingly materially misrepresent” your copyrights – and we may seek to collect those damages:

It appears you are actually trying to report trademark infringement. Since your trademark complaint does not yet contain enough information for us to properly investigate it, please refer to our trademark policy for more information. We recommend using the included form to submit a properly-formatted complaint:
